Currently, I'm an AI Expert Rater at TELUS International, where I analyze and rate various ad formats to ensure AI guideline compliance for optimal client results. With over three years of experience as a General Manager at Doble E, I've overseen all aspects of real estate operations, from showings and structural repairs to budget management and contractor oversight. My journey also includes hosting television and YouTube shows, collaborating with brands, and innovating digital content at TVX.</p>  
    <p>As a Social Media Manager at Rivera & Rivera, I devised   
      effective social media strategies, while my role as a Digital Content Producer and Content Analyst at Grupo Editorial Altamirano involved multimedia coordination and innovative platform development. In my early career, as a Senior Spanish Content Writer at Diply, I created high-quality Spanish content, tracked performance, and optimized articles for maximum impact.
